#Basics

 ■ □ There are 2 shades for each block, white = 0 black = 1, there is 8 blocks in a column
	 2^8 gives us values of 0 - 255. Each command is represented by a
	 value, this command is followed by a signed int from -127 - 127
	 which specifies the ammount it should be moved/rotated by. The
	 stop command ends the program.

#Commands

1. Move  
Moves forward in by the amount specified  
The amount is affected by the scale amount
	 
2. Rotate  
Rotates the turtle by the amount specified in the next block  
The amount is calculated by the midpoint being no change in angle and 0 being maximum turn left and 255 being maximum turn right.

3. Loop  
Loops by the specified number, must be followed by a EndLoop

4. EndLoop  
Goes back to the loop and decrements the loop counter by 1
 	
5. Jump  
Jumps by the specified X and Y ignoring angles (takes 2 args) 
 	
You can change some var's before running Start(), you can use this to change the starting position, angle, max turn angle or number of bits expected.
